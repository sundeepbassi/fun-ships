# Notes for resubmission of this project

I was informed by student care and the webinair that I watched from Jo C that the projects needed to be live for a certificate to be awarded.  I had to contact the tutors as the project was not being deployed to Heroku.  The tutors helped me to set it back up to live again on Heroku.

Hi tutors, I was informed by student care and the webinair I watched on migrating databases to elephant sql by jo c that we have to have our projects live for them to get a certificates. Gemma and Sean have been very kind in getting my project 5 and project 4 back up live on heroku however I am trying to get my project 3 to be live and tried the steps that sean kindly showed me yesterday but I am not sure how to link up the project 3 to heroku as this was the python project.

Sean profile
Hi Sunny, pp3 does not have a database, so there is nothing new to do with that one, is it not working for you at the moment?
Hi Sean good to hear from you when I try to open the app it does not work on Heroku

Sean profile
ok, then we likely have to scale the application again
ok Sean how would I do that ?
in the second terminal, please login to heroku
Sean profile
Remember that you need the api key instead of the password
it is giving an error shall I use the API code from yestrday that I usedto login
Sean profile
yes please
Thanks I will give it a go
Thanks Sean that worked
ok, its working again

So, you needed to restart the dyno with the command
heroku ps:scale web=1 --app  <app_name>
Sean profile
ok, seems to be running fine now, Enjoy your day and happy coding :)
1:52 pm
Thans Sean you are a star tutor always good to chat with you and thank you, do I need to add the code above ?
no, its all done

- I would like to say the support and encouragement from my mentor Miguel Martinez has been exceptionally outstanding. Miguel has never given up on me and I feel his support got me through a lot of stress and anxiety when I was doing this project.  I am forever touched with Miguels kindness and empathy and he has taught me the true meaning of dedication and commitment.  Miguel is a brilliant mentor and a great teacher.

- I would also like to say thank you to all of the tutor support team for spending time with me to try and get the correct code to work.  There were times when I did not understand and the tutors were patient with me and helped me to work through the issues.

- This project is being resubmitted as it only failed on one point in the criteria.

- The point it failed on is 2.1	Write code that handles empty or invalid input data.

- The above has now been rectified with the support of my mentor and the tutors.

- I have added two extra sections that explain how the code was rectified and where the problem needed to be rectified. I am grateful to the assessors for pointing out in the report that the data to be entered was to be between 1-9 and that 0 and -1 had been inputted and accepted by the code.  This problem has now been rectified and thoroughly tested and no invalid data is being processed.

- The two sections added to the readme are:

    - Bugs and Invalid Data Rectified From Submission of First Project

    - 2.1	Write code that handles empty or invalid input data. 

- I have also done an updated pep8 online check that passed without any faults and this can be found in the validator testing section of this readme. As I had submitted new code I wanted to ensure that it was checked properly by pep8 online checker.

## Fun-Ships

- Fun-Ships is a noughts and crosses game (tik tak toe in American) designed on the original paper played game.

- For more information about noughts and crosses check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

- Funships is coded in python and the code is outputted in the terminal the game is also deployed to Heroku.

- The game is designed to be played by a single person against the computer.

- The objective of the game is for the player to place  3 X's on the grid board in a line to win.


## How To Play

- The player has to input a number from 1 to 9.

- Then the player is prompted to enter another number.

- X represents the players symbol on the grid.

- O represents the computer symbol on the grid.

- The player must try to get three x's in a line.

- The Computer will try to block the player.

- The player and the computer can start the game.

## Features



### Existing Features

- The screenshot below is the game displayed on various screens.

- [Game On Various Screens](assets/screenshots/multiscreen.png)

- There ia a grid board for the player to play the game.

- The player is greeted with a welcome.

- The player is given an option to input a number value for the grid board from 1 - 9.

- The screenshot below shows the start of the game.

- [Start The Game](assets/screenshots/startgames.png)

- The player is prompted again to input a numnber and this will continue until either the player or computer wins, 
  loses or there is a draw.

- If both sides score a draw the player will be notified as shown in the draw screenshot below.

- [There is a draw](assets/screenshots/draw.png)

- If the player loses the game this will be displayed in the terminal as seen in the screenshot below.

- [Player has lost the game](assets/screenshots/lost.png)

- If the player inputs letters, symbols or an empty return the following message will be displayed by the computer.

- [Message For Incorrect Inputs](assets/screenshots/inputreq.png)

- The screenshot below displays the response when the player inputs the wrong number

- [Wrong Number](assets/screenshots/wrongnum.png)


### Future Features

- Allow player to have the opportunity to play against someone else.


###  Data Model
 
The model that I am using for this project is based on a grid board function.

The grid board function contains both the players turn and the computers turn.

The grid board functions are, define the board, who goes first, print the board, is the board full, check if there is a winner,
is a space free, place a marker on the board, who goes first, player turn, create a copy of the board, computer turn, check if player can win, if computer plays first, and run the game.

There is a choice to put in a number between 1 to 9.

###  Testing

- I did manual testing on the project by:

- Putting the code into the Pep8 linter validator testing check.  The code was passed without any problems and errors.

- I also did tests on the inputs to see what would happen if I inputted a number above 9. The function works because 
  the player is prompted to input a number between 1 and 9.

  I did a test with my mentor to see what would happen if I inputted a letter, a symbol and an empty space.  A bug was removed. The output for this test was working and informed the player to select the correct input required to play the game (numbers between 1-9)

- The code was also tested on the local terminal and in Heroku. 



###  Bugs

- There were bugs in the code that inhibited it from running properly.  I had to contact tutor support and reach out to the slack community for support. The bugs were related to the nesting of the code in the loops.

The bugs were removed and it was the tutorial from Knowledge Mavens that helped to do checks.

- [Knowledge Mavens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe0kIt3kE2g&t=3s) Youtube Tutorial.


### Bugs and Invalid Data Rectified From Submission of First Project
- Through the assessors kind feedback of the project it was noted in the assessment that in criteria 2.1 had failed as the allowance of invalid data entry causes the function to go wrong.  Through the support of my mentor and the tutor support we managed to locate the specific issue of why the game was allowing 0 to be accepted as an input.  This was rectified with the code being made more specific to what input was allowed to be run. 

- The assessor also kindly noted in the feedback that " The input range of the game is 1-9, however, the program takes 0 as input and proceeds. Moreover, when the user gives input of -1 the program does not raise error, accepts the user input." 

- Through the kind support of the tutors I was able to rectify the above issue by adding the code below to ensure that only the specified integers could be accepted from 1-9.  The game will not accept 0 as an input now. The -1 problem was resolved I also checked with +1 and this was not accepted.  

- The code that I used to rectify this is re.match(r'^\d+$', str(position)):
I also had to put import re at the top.  The tutors at the Code Institute helped me with this.

- The code that was inputting the incorrect data entry value was located in player turn.  
The code was rectified and the code now works and invalid data entry is not permitted. My mentor Miguel Martinez and the tutors at code institute helped me with this.  I am very grateful to them for their kind support.


### 2.1	Write code that handles empty or invalid input data. 

- The code that was causing the input of invalid data has now been rectified.

- The screenshot below was taken on the 13th of February 2002 and it shows the code that was rectified to stop the invalid input of data.  My mentor and the tutors supported me into checking the code thoroughly and to input the correct code to ensure that invalid data could not be inputed into the game by the user.

 ![Screenshot of code rectified for player turn](assets/screenshots/playerturn.png)


- The screenshot below was taken on the 13th of February 2002 and it shows that the input data has been checked.

 ![Screenshot of checking data input](assets/screenshots/datacheck.png)
 

 - The screenshot below was taken on the 13th of February 2002 and it shows input data for symbols on a keyboard and empty spaces were rejected as invalid data.

  ![Screenshot of checking data input](assets/screenshots/seconddatacheck.png)

 - The screenshot below was taken on the 13th of February 2002 and it shows what happens when a player inputs a number that has already been inputted, it states this position is not free, please try again.

   ![Screenshot of position not free](assets/screenshots/notfree.png)


###  Remaining Bugs

No remaining bugs

###  Validator Testing

  empowered me to find solutions with debugging the code, thinking about what the code is doing and keeping focused with the 
  project. My mentor is an excellent support for me in helping me to code better.

- My mentor also identified a bug on line 62 onwards and he empowered me to try and find a solution into how this could rectified.
  we had to look at using the Whilst true, Try, Break and Except code to get the bug and error removed.

- I was informed by tutor support to use print() under lines of code to try to identify errors and bugs in why the code
  is not working.

- Tutor support also advised me to use the collapable arrows on the side of the code line so as to check if specific sections of 
  a loop are aligned correctly.

- Fellow students on slack showed me how to use the debugger in the python file and how to try to find bugs in the code.

- One thing that I really learnt with python is the importance of indentation in the code and how incorrect indentation can make 
  the code inoperative.

- A very good resource for helping with code structurtes with python.
